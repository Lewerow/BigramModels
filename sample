morning room in algernon S flat in halfa moon Street the room IS luxuriously Anda artistically furnished the sound of a piano IS heard in the adjoining room did you hear what i wy playing lać i didn T think Ita polite to listen sir I metr sorry for that for your sake i don T play accurately any on can play accurately but i play with wonderful expression as far as the piano IS concerned sentiment IS my forte i keep science for life Anda speaking of the science of life have you Got the cucumber sandwiches cut for lady bracknell oh by the way lać i see from your book that on thursday night when lord shoreman Anda mr worthing were dining with mój eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed yes sir eight bottles Anda a pint why IS Ita that at a bachelor sekunda establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne i ask merely for information i attribute Ita to the superior quality of the wine sir i have often observed that in married households the champagne IS rarely of a first rate brand IS marriage SO demoralising as that i believe Ita IS a Vera pleasant state sir i have had Vera little experience of Ita myself UP to the present i have only been married once that wy in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself Anda a Young persona i Don T know that i AM mucha interested in your family life lać no sir Ita IS NOT a Vera interesting subject i never think of Ita myself Vera natural i AM sure that willa do lać thank you thank you sir lać sekunda views on marriage seem somewhat lax really if the lower orders Don T set US a good example what on earth IS the use of them they seem as a class to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility mr Ernest worthing how are you my dear Ernest what brings you UP to town oh pleasure pleasure what else should bring on anywhere eating as usual i see algy i believe Ita IS customary in good Society to take some slight refreshment at five o clock where have you been since last thursday in the country what on earth do you do there when on IS in town on amuses oneself when on IS in the country on amuses other people Ita IS excessively boring Anda WHO are the people you amuse oh neighbours neighbours Got Nika neighbours in your part of shropshire never speak to on of them how immensely you must amuse them by the way shropshire IS your county IS Ita NOT yes of course why all these cups why cucumber sandwiches why such reckless extravagance in on SO Young WHO IS coming to tea oh merely aunt august Anda gwendolen how perfectly delightful yes that IS all Vera well but i AM afraid aunt Augusta won T quite approve of your being here May i ask why my dear fellow the way you flirt with gwendolen IS perfectly disgraceful Ita IS almost as bad as the way gwendolen flirts with you i AM in love with gwendolen i have come UP to town expressly to propose to Hera i thought you had come UP for pleasure i call that business how utterly unromantic you are i really don T see anything romantic in proposing Ita IS Vera romantic to be in love but there IS nothing romantic about a definite proposal why on May be accepted on usually IS i believe then the excitement IS all over the Vera essence of romanca IS uncertainty if ever i get married i ll certainly try to forget the fact i have no doubt about that dear algy the divorce court wy specially invented for people whose memories are SO curiously constituted oh there IS no use speculating on that subject divorces are made in heaven please Don T touch the cucumber sandwiches they are ordered specially for aunt august well you have been eating them all the time that IS quite a different matter she IS my aunt have some bread Anda butter the bread Anda butter IS for gwendolen gwendolen IS devoted to bread Anda butter Anda Vera good bread Anda butter Ita IS too well my dear fellow you need NOT eat as if you were going to eat Ita all you behave as if you were married to Hera already you are NOT married to Hera already Anda i Don T think you ever willa be why on earth do you say that well in the first plac girlsa never Marr the MEN they flirt with girlsa don T think Ita right oh that IS nonsense Ita IS a great truth Ita accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that on sees all over the plac in the second plac i Don T give my consent my dear fellow gwendolen IS my first cousin Anda before i allow you to Marr Hera you willa have to clear UP the whole question of cecily what on earth do you mean what do you mean algy by cecily i don T know any on of the name of cecily bring mój that cigarette case mr worthing left in the smoking room the last time he dined here do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time i wish to goodness you had let mój know i have been writing frantic letters to scotland yard about Ita i wy Vera nearly offering a large reward well i wish you would offer on i happen to be more than usually hard UP there IS no good offering a large reward now that the thing IS found i think that IS rather mean of you Ernest i must say however Ita makes no matter for now that i look at the inscription inside i find that the thing isn T yours after all of course Ita sekunda mine you have seen mój with Ita a hundred times Anda you have no right whatsoever to read what IS written inside Ita IS a Vera ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case oh Ita IS absurd to have a hard Anda fast rule about what on should read Anda what on shouldn T more than halfa of modern culture depends on what on shouldn T read i AM quite aware of the fact Anda i Don T propose to discuss modern culture Ita isn T the sort of thing on should talk of in private i simply wanta my cigarette case back yes but this isn T your cigarette case this cigarette case IS a present from some on of the name of cecily Anda you said you didn T know any on of that name well if you wanta to know cecily happens to be my aunt charming old lady she IS too lives at tunbridge Wells Just give Ita back to mój algy but why does she call herself little cecily if she IS your aunt Anda lives at tunbridge Wells from little cecily with Hera fondest love my dear fellow what on earth IS there in that some aunts are tall some aunts are NOT tall that IS a matter that surely an aunt May be allowed to decide for herself you seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt that IS absurd for heaven sekunda sake give mój back my cigarette case but why does your aunt call you Hera uncle from little cecily with Hera fondest love to Hera dear uncle Jack there IS no objection i admit to an aunt being a small aunt but why an aunt no matter what Hera size May be should call Hera own nephew Hera uncle i can T quite make out besides your name isn T Jack at all Ita IS Ernest Ita isn T Ernest Ita sekunda Jack you have always told mój Ita wy Ernesta i have introduced you to every on as Ernest you answer to the name of Ernest you look as if your name wy Ernest you are the most earnest looking persona i ever Sawa in my life Ita IS perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn T Ernest Ita sekunda on your cards here IS on of them mr Ernest worthing B the Alban i ll keep this as a proof that your name IS Ernest if ever you attempt to deny Ita to mój or to gwendolen or to any on else well my name IS Ernest in town Anda Jack in the country Anda the cigarette case wy given to mój in the country yes but that does NOT account for the fact that your small aunt cecily WHO lives at tunbridge Wells calls you Hera dear uncle come old Boy you had mucha better have the thing out at once my dear algy you talk exactly as if you were a dentist Ita IS Vera vulgar to talk like a dentist when on isn T a dentist Ita produces a false impression well that IS exactly what dentists always do now on on Tell mój the whole thing i May mention that i have always suspected you of being a confirmed Anda Secret bunburyist Anda i AM quite sure of Ita now bunburyist what on earth do you mean by a bunburyist i ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform mój why you are Ernest in town Anda Jack in the country well produce my cigarette case first here Ita IS now produce your explanation Anda pray make Ita improbable my dear fellow there IS nothing improbable about my explanation at all in fact Ita sekunda perfectly ordinary old mr Thomas cardew WHO adopted mój when i wy a little Boy made mój in his willa guardian to his grand daughter miss cecily cardew cecily WHO addresses mój as Hera uncle from motives of respect that you could NOT possibly appreciate lives at my plac in the country under the charge of Hera admirable governess miss prism where IS that plac in the country by the way that IS nothing to you dear Boy you are NOT going to be invited i May Tell you candidly that the plac IS NOT in shropshire i suspected that my dear fellow i have bunburyed all over shropshire on two separate occasions now go on why are you Ernest in town Anda Jack in the country my dear algy i don T know whether you willa be Abel to understand my real motives you are hardly serious enough when on IS placed in the position of guardian on Has to adopt a Vera high moral tone on all subjects Ita S on sekunda duty to do SO Anda as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce Vera mucha to either on sekunda health or on sekunda happiness in order to get UP to town i have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest WHO lives in the Alban Anda gets into the most dreadful scrapes that my dear algy IS the whole truth pure Anda simple the truth IS rarely pure Anda never simple modern life would be Vera tedious if Ita were either Anda modern literature a complete impossibility that wouldn T be at all a bad thing literary criticism IS NOT your forte my dear fellow Don T try Ita you should leave that to people WHO haven T been at a university they do Ita SO well in the daily papers what you really are IS a bunburyist i wy quite right in saying you were a bunburyist you are on of the most advanced bunburyists i know what on earth do you mean you have invented a Vera useful younger brother called Ernest in order that you May be Abel to come UP to town as often as you like i have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called bunbury in order that i May be Abel to on Down into the country whenever i choose bunbury IS perfectly invaluable if Ita wasn T for bunbury sekunda extraordinary bad health for instance i wouldn T be Abel to dine with you at Willis sekunda to night for i have been really engaged to aunt Augusta for more than a week i haven T asked you to dine with mój anywhere to night you are absurdly careless about sending out invitations Ita IS Vera foolish of you nothing annoys people SO mucha as NOT receiving invitations you had mucha better dine with your aunt August i haven T the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind to Begina with i dined there on monday Anda once a week IS quite enough to dine with on sekunda own relations in the second plac whenever i do dine there i AM always treated as a member of the family Anda sent Down with either no woman at all or two in the third plac i know perfectly well whom she willa plac mój next to to night she willa plac mój next mara farquhar WHO always flirts with Hera own husband across the dinner table that IS NOT Vera pleasant indeed Ita IS NOT even decent Anda that sort of thing IS enormously on the increase the amount of women in London WHO flirt with their own husbands IS perfectly scandalous Ita looks SO bad Ita IS simply washing on sekunda clean linen in public besides now that i know you to be a confirmed bunburyist i naturally wanta to talk to you about bunburying i wanta to tell you the rules I metr NOT a bunburyist at all if gwendolen accepts mój i AM going to kill my brother indeed i think i ll kill him in any case cecily IS a little too mucha interested in him Ita IS rather a bore SO i AM going to get rid of Ernest Anda i strongly advise you to do the sam with mr with your invalid friend WHO Has the absurd name nothing willa induce mój to part with bunbury Anda if you ever get married which seems to mój extremely problematic you willa be Vera glad to know bunbury a man WHO marries without knowing bunbury Has a Vera tedious time of Ita that IS nonsense if i Marr a charming girl like gwendolen Anda she IS the only girl i ever Sawa in my life that i would Marr i certainly won T wanta to know bunbury then your wife willa you Don T seem to realise that in married life three IS company Anda two IS none that my dear Young friend IS the theory that the corrupt french drama Has been propounding for the last fifty years yes Anda that the happy english home Has proved in halfa the time for heaven sekunda sake don T try to be cynical Ita sekunda perfectly easy to be cynical my dear fellow Ita isn T easy to be anything nowadays there sekunda such a LOT of beastly competition about ah that must be aunt Augusta only relatives or creditors ever ring in that wagnerian manner now if i get Hera out of the way for ten minutes SO that you can have an opportunity for proposing to gwendolen May i dine with you to night at Willis sekunda i suppose SO if you wanta to yes but you must be serious about Ita i hate people WHO are NOT serious about meals Ita IS SO shallow of them lada bracknell Anda miss fairfax good afternoon dear algernon i hope you are behaving Vera well i metr feeling Vera well aunt august that sekunda NOT quite the sam thing in fact the two things rarely on together dear mój you are smart i AM always smart AM i NOT mr worthing you RE quite perfect miss fairfax oh i hope i AM NOT that Ita would leave no room for developments Anda i intend to develop in mana directions I metr sorry if w are a little late algernon but i wy obliged to call on dear lady harbury i hadn T been there since Hera poor husband sekunda death i never Sawa a woman SO altered she looks quite twenty years younger Anda now i ll have a cupać of tea Anda on of those Nika cucumber sandwiches you promised mój certainly aunt Augusta won T you come Anda sit here gwendolen thanks mamma I metr quite comfortable where i AM why are there no cucumber sandwiches i ordered them specially there were no cucumbers in the market this morning sir i wenta Down twice NOT even for ready money that willa do lać thank you thank you sir i AM greatly distressed aunt Augusta about there being no cucumbers NOT even for ready money Ita really makes no matter algernon i had some crumpets with lady harbury WHO seems to mój to be living entirely for pleasure now i hear Hera hair Has turned quite Golda from grief Ita certainly Has changed its colour from what cause i of course cannot say i ve quite a treat for you to night algernon i AM going to send you Down with mara farquhar she IS such a Nika woman Anda SO attentive to Hera husband Ita sekunda delightful to watch them i AM afraid aunt August i shall have to give UP the pleasure of dining with you to night after all i hope NOT algernon Ita would put my table completely out your uncle would have to dine upstairs fortunately he IS accustomed to that Ita IS a great bore Anda i need hardly say a terrible disappointment to mój but the fact IS i have Just had a telegram to say that my poor friend bunbury IS Vera ill again they seem to think i should be with him Ita IS Vera strange this mr bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health yes poor bunbury IS a dreadful invalid well i must say algernon that i think Ita IS high time that mr bunbury made UP his mind whether he wy going to live or to die this shilly shallying with the question IS absurd Nora do I inaczej any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids i consider Ita morbid illness of any kind IS hardly a thing to be encouraged in others health IS the primary duty of life i AM always telling that to your poor uncle but he never seems to take mucha notice as far as any improvement in his ailment goes i should be mucha obliged if you would ask mr bunbury from mój to be kind enough NOT to have a relapse on saturday for i rely on you to arrange my music for mój Ita IS my last reception Anda on wants something that willa encourage conversation particularly at the end of the season when every on Has practically said whatever they had to say which in most cases wy probably NOT mucha i ll speak to bunbury aunt Augusta if he IS still conscious Anda i think i can promise you he ll be all right by saturday of course the music IS a great difficulty you see if on plays good music people Don T listen Anda if on plays bad music people Don T talk but i ll run over the programme i ve drawn out if you willa kindly come into the next room for a moment thank you algernon Ita IS Vera thoughtful of you I metr sure the programme willa be delightful after a few expurgations french songs i cannot possibly allow people always seem to think that they are improper Anda either look shocked which IS vulgar or laugh which IS worse but german sounds a thoroughly respectable language Anda indeed i believe IS SO gwendolen you willa accompany mój charming day Ita Has been miss fairfax pray Don T talk to mój about the weather mr worthing whenever people talk to mój about the weather i always feel quite certain that they mean something else Anda that makes mój SO nervous i do mean something else i thought SO in fact i AM never wrong Anda i would like to be allowed to take advantage of lady bracknell S temporary absence i would certainly advise you to do SO mamma Has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that i have often had to speak to Hera about miss fairfax ever since i meta you i have admired you more than any girl i have ever meta since i meta you yes i AM quite well aware of the fact Anda i often wish that in public at any rate you had been more demonstrative for mój you have always had an irresistible fascination even before i meta you i wy far from indifferent to you w live as i hope you know mr worthing in an Age of ideals the fact IS constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines Anda Has reached the provincial pulpits i AM told Anda my ideal Has always been to love some on of the name of Ernest there IS something in that name that inspires absolute confidence the moment algernon first mentioned to mój that he had a friend called Ernest i knew i wy destined to love you you really love mój gwendolen you Don T know how happy you ve made mój my own Ernest but you Don T really mean to say that you couldn T love mój if my name wasn T Ernest but your name IS Ernest yes i know Ita IS but supposing Ita wy something else do you mean to say you couldn T love mój then ah that IS clearly a metaphysical speculation Anda like most metaphysical speculations Has Vera little reference at all to the actual facts of real life as w know them personally darling to speak quite candidly i don T mucha care about the name of Ernest i don T think the name suits mój at all Ita suits you perfectly Ita IS a divine name Ita Has a music of its own Ita produces vibrations well really gwendolen i must say that i think there are lots of other mucha nicer names i think Jack for instance a charming name Jack no there IS Vera little music in the name Jack if any at all indeed Ita does NOT thrill Ita produces absolutely no vibrations i have known several jacks Anda they all without exception were more than usually plain besides Jack IS a notorious domesticity for John Anda i pita any woman WHO IS married to a man called John she would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a singel moment sekunda solitude the only really safe name IS Ernest gwendolen i must get christened at once i mean w must get married at once there IS no time to be lost married mr worthing well surely you know that i love you Anda you Leda mój to believe miss fairfax that you were NOT absolutely indifferent to mój i adore you but you haven T proposed to mój yet nothing Has been said at all about marriage the subject Has NOT even been touched on well May i propose to you now i think Ita would be an admirable opportunity Anda to spare you any possible disappointment mr worthing i think Ita only fair to tell you quite frankly before hand that i AM fully determined to accept you yes mr worthing what have you Got to say to mój you know what i have Got to say to you yes but you Don T say Ita gwendolen willa you Marr mój of course i willa darling how long you have been about Ita i AM afraid you have had Vera little experience in how to propose my own on i have never loved any on in the world but you yes but MEN often propose for practice i know my brother Gerald does all my girl friends tell mój SO what wonderfully blue eyes you have Ernest they are quite quite blue i hope you willa always look at mój Just like that especially when there are other people present rise sir from this semi recumbent posture Ita IS most indecorous i must beg you to retire this IS no plac for you besides mr worthing Has NOT quite finished yet finished what May i ask i AM engaged to mr worthing mamma pardon mój you are NOT engaged to any on when you do become engaged to some on i or your father should his health permit him willa inform you of the fact an engagement should come on a Young girl as a surprise pleasant or unpleasant as the case May be Ita IS hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself Anda now i have a few questions to put to you mr worthing while i AM making these inquiries you gwendolen willa wait for mój below in the carriage in the carriage gwendolen gwendolen the carriage you can take a seat mr worthing thank you lady bracknell i prefer standing i feel bound to tell you that you are NOT Down on my list of eligible Young MEN although i have the sam list as the dear duchessa of bolton Has w work together in fact however i AM quite ready to enter your name should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires do you smoke well yes i must admit i smoke i AM glad to hear Ita a man should always have an occupation of some kind there are far too mana idle MEN in London as Ita IS how old are you a Vera good Age to be married at i have always been of opinion that a man WHO desires to get married should know either everything or nothing which do you know i know nothing lady bracknell i AM pleased to hear Ita i do NOT approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance ignorance IS like a delicate exotic fruit touch Ita Anda the bloom IS gone the whole theory of modern education IS radically unsound fortunately in england at any rate education produces no effect whatsoever if Ita did Ita would prove a serious danger to the upper classes Anda probably lead to acts of violence in grosvenor square what IS your income between seven Anda eight thousand a year in land or in investments in investments chiefly that IS satisfactory what between the duties expected of on during on sekunda lifetime Anda the duties exacted from on after on sekunda death land Has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure Ita gives on position Anda prevents on from keeping Ita UP that sekunda all that can be said about land i have a country house with some land of course attached to Ita about fifteen hundred acres i believe but i Don T depend on that for my real income in fact as far as i can make out the poachers are the only people WHO make anything out of Ita a country House how mana bedrooms well that pointa can be cleared UP afterwards you have a town House i hope a girl with a simple unspoiled nature like gwendolen could hardly be expected to reside in the country well i own a house in belgrave square but Ita IS let by the year to lady bloxham of course i can get Ita back whenever i like at six months notice i don T know Hera oh she goes about Vera little she IS a lady considerably advanced in years ah nowadays that IS no guarantee of respectability of character what number in belgrave square the unfashionable side i thought there wy something however that could easily be altered do you mean the fashion or the side both if necessary i presume what are your politics well i AM afraid i really have none i AM a liberal unionist oh they count as tories they dine with US or come in the evening at any rate now to minor matters are your parents living i have lost both my parents to lose on parent mr worthing May be regarded as a misfortune to lose both looks like carelessness WHO wy your father he wy evidently a man of some wealth wy he Borna in what the radical papers call the purple of commerce or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy i AM afraid i really don T know the fact IS lady bracknell i said i had lost my parents Ita would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost mój i Don T actually know WHO i AM by birth i wy well i wy found the late mr Thomas cardew an old gentleman of a Vera charitable Anda kindly disposition found mój Anda gave mój the name of worthing because he happened to have a first class ticket for worthing in his pocket at the time worthing IS a plac in sussex Ita IS a seaside resort where did the charitable gentleman WHO had a first class ticket for this seaside resort find you in a hand bag yes lady bracknell i wy in a hand bag a somewhat large black leather hand bag with handles to Ita an ordinary hand bag in fact in what locality did this mr James or Thomas cardew come across this ordinary hand bag in the cloak room at Victoria station Ita wy given to him in mistake for his own the cloak room at Victoria station the brighton line the line IS immaterial mr worthing i confess i feel somewhat bewildered by what you have Just told mój to be Borna or at any rate bred in a hand bag whether Ita had handles or NOT seems to mój to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds on of the worst excesses of the french revolution Anda i presume you know what that unfortunate movement Leda to as for the particular locality in which the hand bag wy found a cloak room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion Has probably indeed been used for that purpose before now but Ita could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good Society May i ask you then what you would advise mój to do I need hardly say i would do anything in the world to ensure gwendolen sekunda happiness i would strongly advise you mr worthing to try Anda acquire some relations as soon as possible Anda to make a definite effort to produce at any rate on parent of either sex before the season IS quite over well i don T see how i could possibly manage to do that i can produce the hand bag at any moment Ita IS in my dressing room at home i really think that should satisfy you lady bracknell what Has Ita to do with mój you can hardly imagine that i Anda lord bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter a girl brought UP with the utmost care to Marr into a cloak room Anda forma an alliance with a parcela good morning mr worthing for goodness sake don T play that ghastly tune algy how idiotic you are didn T Ita on off all right old Boy you don T mean to say gwendolen refused you i know Ita IS a way she Has she IS always refusing people i think Ita IS most ill natured of Hera oh gwendolen IS as right as a trivet as far as she IS concerned w are engaged Hera mother IS perfectly unbearable never meta such a gorgona i Don T really know what a gorgona IS like but i AM quite sure that lady bracknell IS on in any case she IS a monstera without being a myth which IS rather unfair i beg your pardon algy i suppose i shouldn T talk about your own aunt in that way before you my dear Boy i love hearing my relations abused Ita IS the only thing that makes mój put UP with them at all relations are simply a tedious pack of people WHO haven T Got the remotest knowledge of how to live Nora the smallest instinct about when to die oh that IS nonsense well i won T argue about the matter you always wanta to argue about things that IS exactly what things were originally made for upon my Word if i thought that I D shoot myself you don T think there IS any chance of gwendolen becoming like Hera mother in about a hundred Anda fifty years do you algy all women become like their mothers that IS their tragedy no man does IS that clever Ita IS perfectly phrased Anda quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be i AM sick to death of cleverness everybody IS clever nowadays you can T on anywhere without meeting clever people the thing Has become an absolute public nuisance i wish to goodness w had a few fools left i should extremely like to meet them what do they talk about oh about the clever people of course by the way did you Tell gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in town Anda Jack in the country my dear fellow the truth isn T quite the sort of thing on tells to a Nika sweet refined girl what extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman the only way to behave to a woman IS to make love to Hera if she IS pretty Anda to some on else if she IS plain oh that IS nonsense what about your brother what about the profligate Ernest oh before the end of the week i shall have Got rid of him i ll say he died in paris of apoplexy lots of people die of apoplexy quite suddenly don T they yes but Ita sekunda hereditary my dear fellow Ita sekunda a sort of thing that runs in families you had mucha better say a severe chill you are sure a severe chill isn T hereditary or anything of that kind of course Ita isn T Vera well then my poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly in paris by a severe chill that gets rid of him but i thought you said that miss cardew wy a little too mucha interested in your poor brother Ernest won T she feel his loss a good deal oh that IS all right cecily IS NOT a silly romantic girl i AM glad to say she Has Got a capital appetite goes long walks Anda pays no attention at all to Hera lessons i would rather like to see cecily i willa take Vera good care you never do she IS excessively pretty Anda she IS only Just eighteen have you told gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward WHO IS only Just eighteen oh on doesn T blurt these things out to people cecily Anda gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends i ll bet you anything you like that halfa an hour after they have meta they willa be calling each other sister women only do that when they have called each other a LOT of other things first now my dear Boy if w wanta to get a good table at Willis S w really must on Anda dress do you know Ita IS nearly seven Ita always IS nearly seven well I metr hungry I never knew you when you weren T what shall w do after dinner on to a theatre i loathe listening well let US on to the Club i hate talking well w might trot round to the empire at ten i can T bear looking at things Ita IS SO silly well what shall w do Ita IS awfully hard work doing nothing however i don T mind hard work where there IS no definite object of any kind gwendolen upon my Word algy kindly turn your back i have something Vera particular to say to mr worthing really gwendolen i don T think I can allow this at all algy you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life you are NOT quite old enough to do that my own darling Ernest w May never be married from the expression on mamma sekunda face i fear w never shall few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them the old fashioned respect for the Young IS fast dying out whatever influenca i ever had over mamma i lost at the Age of three but although she May prevent US from becoming man Anda wife Anda i May Marr some on else Anda Marr often nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you the stora of your romantic origin as related to mój by mamma with unpleasing comments Has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature your Christian name Has an irresistible fascination the simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to mój your town address at the Alban i have what IS your address in the country the manor house woolton hertfordshire there IS a good postal Service i suppose Ita May be necessary to do something desperate that of course willa require serious consideration i willa communicate with you daily my own on how long do you remain in town algy you May turn round now thanks i ve turned round already you May also ring the Bell you willa let mój see you to your carriage my own darling i willa see miss fairfax out a glass of sherry lać to morrow lać i metr going bunburying i shall probably NOT be back till monday you can put UP my dress clothes my smoking jacket Anda all the bunbury suits i hope to morrow willa be a fine day lać Ita never IS sir lać you RE a perfect pessimist i do my best to give satisfaction sir there sekunda a sensible intellectual girl the only girl i ever cared for inaczej my life what on earth are you SO amused at oh I metr a little anxious about poor bunbury that IS all if you Don T take care your friend bunbury willa get you into a serious scrape some day i love scrapes they are the only things that are never serious oh that sekunda nonsense algy you never talk anything but nonsense nobody ever does garden at the manor house a flight of grey Stone steps leads UP to the house the garden an old fashioned on full of roses time of year july basket chairs Anda a table covered with books are set under a large yew tree surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers IS rather moulton sekunda duty than yours especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you your german grammar IS on the table pray open Ita at page fifteen w willa repeat yesterday sekunda lesson but i Don T like German Ita isn T at all a becoming language i know perfectly well that i look quite plain after my German lesson child you know how anxious your guardian IS that you should improve yourself in every way he laid particular stress on your German as he wy leaving for town yesterday indeed he always lays stress on your german when he IS leaving for town dear uncle Jack IS SO Vera serious sometimes he IS SO serious that i think he cannot be quite well your guardian enjoys the best of health Anda his gravity of demeanour IS especially to be commended in on SO comparatively Young as he IS i know no on WHO Has a higher sense of duty Anda responsibility i suppose that IS why he often looks a little bored when w three are together i AM surprised at you mr worthing Has mana troubles in his life idle merriment Anda triviality would be out of plac in his conversation you must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate Young man his brother i wish uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate Young man his brother to come Down here sometimes w might have a good influenca over him miss prism i AM sure you certainly would you know german Anda geology Anda things of that kind influenca a man Vera mucha i do NOT think that even i could produce any effect on a character that according to his own brother sekunda admission IS irretrievably weak Anda vacillating indeed i AM NOT sure that i would desire to reclaim him i AM NOT in favour of this modern Mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment S notice as a man sows SO let him reap you must put away your diary cecily i really don T see why you should keep a diary at all i keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life if i didn T write them Down i should probably forget all about them memory my dear cecily IS the diary that w all Carra about with US yes but Ita usually chronicles the things that have never happened Anda couldn T possibly have happened i believe that memory IS responsible for nearly all the three volume novels that mudie sends US do NOT speak slightingly of the three volume novel cecily i wrote on myself in earlier days did you really miss prism how wonderfully clever you are i hope Ita did NOT end happily i don T like novels that end happily they depress mój SO mucha the good ended happily Anda the bad unhappily that IS what fiction means i suppose SO but Ita seems Vera unfair Anda wy your novel ever published the manuscript unfortunately wy abandoned i use the Word in the sense of lost or mislaid to your work child these speculations are profitless but i see dear dr chasuble coming UP through the garden this IS indeed a pleasure Anda how are w this morning miss prism you are i trust well miss prism Has Just been complaining of a slight headache i think Ita would do Hera SO mucha good to have a short stroll with you in the park dr chasuble cecily i have NOT mentioned anything about a headache no dear miss prism i know that but i felt instinctively that you had a headache indeed i wy thinking about that Anda NOT about my german lesson when the rector came in i hope cecily you are NOT inattentive oh i AM afraid i AM that IS strange were i fortunate enough to be miss prism sekunda pupil i would hanga upon Hera lips i spoke metaphorically my metaphor wy drawn from bees mr worthing i suppose Has NOT returned from town yet w do NOT expect him till monday afternoon ah yes he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London he IS NOT on of those whose Soła aim IS enjoyment as by all accounts that unfortunate Young man his brother seems to be but i must NOT disturb Egeria Anda Hera pupil any longer my name IS laetitia doctor a classical allusion merely drawn from the pagan authors i shall see you both no doubt at evensong i think dear doctor i willa have a stroll with you i find i have a headache after all Anda a walka might do Ita good with pleasure miss prism with pleasure w might go as far as the schools Anda back that would be delightful cecily you willa read your political economy in my absence the chapter on the fall of the rupee you May omit Ita IS somewhat too sensational even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side horrid political economy horrid horrid German mr Ernest worthing Has Just driven over from the station he Has brought his luggage with him mr Ernest worthing bit the Alban w uncle Jack sekunda brother did you Tell him mr worthing wy in town he seemed Vera mucha disappointed i mentioned that you Anda miss prism were in the garden he said he wy anxious to speak to you privately for a moment ask mr Ernest worthing to come here i suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper about a room for him i have never meta any really wicked persona before i feel rather frightened i AM SO afraid he willa look Just like every on else you are my little cousin cecily I metr sure you are under some strange mistake i AM NOT little in fact i believe i AM more than usually tall for my Age but i AM your cousin cecily you i see from your card are uncle Jack sekunda brother my cousin Ernest my wicked cousin Ernest oh i AM NOT really wicked at all cousin cecily you mustn T think that i AM wicked if you are NOT then you have certainly been deceiving US all in a Vera inexcusable manner i hope you have NOT been leading a double life pretending to be wicked Anda being really good all the time that would be hypocrisy of course i have been rather reckless i AM glad to hear Ita in fact now you mention the subject i have been Vera bad in my own small way i don T think you should be SO proud of that though i AM sure Ita must have been Vera pleasant Ita IS mucha pleasanter being here with you i can T understand how you are here at all uncle Jack won T be back till monday afternoon that IS a great disappointment i AM obliged to on UP by the first train on monday morning i have a business appointment that i AM anxious to miss couldn T you miss Ita anywhere but in London no the appointment IS in London well i know of course how important Ita IS NOT to keep a business engagement if on wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life but still i think you had better wait till uncle Jack arrives i know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating about my what he Has gone UP to buy your outfit i certainly wouldn T let Jack buy my outfit he Has no taste in neckties at all i don T think you willa require neckties uncle Jack IS sending you to Australia I D sooner die well he said at dinner on wednesday night that you would have to choose between this world the next world Anda Australia the accounts i have received of Australia Anda the next world are NOT particularly encouraging this world IS good enough for mój cousin cecily yes but are you good enough for Ita I metr afraid I metr NOT that that IS why i wanta you to reformy mój you might make that your mission if you Don T mind cousin cecily I metr afraid i ve no time this afternoon well would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon Ita IS rather quixotic of you but i think you should try i feel better already you are looking a little worse that IS because i AM hungry how thoughtless of mój i should have remembered that when on IS going to lead an entirely Newa life on requires regular Anda wholesome meals won T you come in might i have a buttonhole first i never have any appetite unless i have a buttonhole first a marechal niel no i D sooner have a pink rose because you are like a pink rose cousin cecily i don T think Ita can be right for you to talk to mój like that miss prism never says such things to mój then miss prism IS a short sighted old lady you are the prettiest girl i ever Sawa miss prism says that all good looks are a snare they are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in oh i don T think I would care to catch a sensible man i shouldn T know what to talk to him about you are too mucha alone dear dr chasuble you should get married a misanthrope i can understand a womanthrope never believe mój i do NOT deserve SO neologistic a phrase the precept as well as the practice of the primitive church wy distinctly against matrimony that IS obviously the reason why the primitive church Has NOT lasted UP to the present day Anda you do NOT seem to realise dear doctor that by persistently remaining singel a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation MEN should be more careful this Vera celibacy leads weaker vessels astray but IS a man NOT equally attractive when married no married man IS ever attractive except to his wife Anda often i ve been told NOT even to Hera that depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman maturity can always be depended on ripeness can be trusted Young women are green i spoke horticulturally my metaphor wy drawn from fruits but where IS cecily perhaps she followed US to the schools this IS indeed a surprise w did NOT look for you till monday afternoon i have returned sooner than i expected dr chasuble i hope you are well dear mr worthing i trust this garb of woe does NOT betoken some terrible calamity more shameful debts Anda extravagance still leading his life of pleasure your brother Ernest dead what a lesson for him i trust he willa profit by Ita mr worthing i offer you my sincere condolence you have at least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous Anda forgiving of brothers he had mana faults but Ita IS a sad sad blow Vera sad indeed were you with him at the end he died abroad in paris in fact i had a telegram last night from the manager of the grand hotel wy the cause of death mentioned a severe chill Ita seems as a man sows SO shall he reap charity dear miss prism charity none of US are perfect i myself AM peculiarly susceptible to draughts willa the interment take plac here he seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in paris i fear that hardly points to any Vera serious state of mind at the last you would no doubt wish mój to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday my sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion joyful or as in the present case distressing i have preached Ita at harvest celebrations christenings confirmations on days of humiliation Anda festal days the last time i delivered Ita wy in the cathedral as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the prevention of discontent among the upper orders the bishop WHO wy present wy mucha struck by some of the analogies i drwa ah that reminds mój you mentioned christenings i think dr i suppose you know how to christen all right i mean of course you are continually christening arena T you Ita IS i regret to say on of the rector sekunda most constant duties in this parish i have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject but they Don T seem to know what thrift IS but IS there any particular infant in whom you are interested mr worthing your brother wy i believe unmarried wy he NOT people WHO live entirely for pleasure usually are buta Ita IS NOT for any child dear doctor i AM Vera fond of children no the fact IS i would like to be christened myself this afternoon if you have nothing better to do but surely mr worthing you have been christened already i don T remember anything about Ita but have you any grave doubts on the subject i certainly intend to have of course i don T know if the thing would bother you in any way or if you think i AM a little too old now NOT at all the sprinkling Anda indeed the immersion of adults IS a perfectly canonical practice you need have no apprehensions sprinkling IS all that IS necessary or indeed i think advisable our weather IS SO changeable at what hour would you wish the ceremony performed oh i might trot round about five if that would suita you in fact i have two similar ceremonies to perform at that time a case of twins that occurred recently in on of the outlying cottages on your own estate poor jenkins the Carter a most hard working man i don T see mucha fun in being christened along with other babies Ita would be childish would halfa pasta five do Anda now dear mr worthing i willa NOT intrude any longer into a House of sorrow i would merely beg you NOT to be too mucha bowed Down by grief what seem to US bitter trials are often blessings in disguise this seems to mój a blessing of an extremely obvious kind oh i AM pleased to see you back but what horrid clothes you have Got on do on Anda change them my child my child what IS the matter uncle Jack do look happy you look as if you had toothache Anda i have Got such a surprise for you WHO do you think IS in the dining room your brother Ernest he arrived about halfa an hour aga i haven T Got a brother oh don T say that however badly he May have behaved to you in the pasta he IS still your brother you couldn T be SO heartless as to disown him i ll tell him to come out Anda you willa shake hands with him won T you uncle Jack these are Vera joyful tidings after w had all been resigned to his loss his sudden return seems to mój peculiarly distressing my brother IS in the dining room i don T know what Ita all means i think Ita IS perfectly absurd brother John i have come Down from town to Tell you that i AM Vera sorry for all the trouble i have given you Anda that i intend to lead a better life in the future uncle Jack you are NOT going to refuse your own brother S hand nothing willa induce mój to take his hand i think his coming Down here disgraceful he knows perfectly well why uncle Jack do be Nika there IS some good in every on Ernest Has Just been telling mój about his poor invalid friend mr bunbury whom he goes to visit SO often Anda surely there must be mucha good in on WHO IS kind to an invalid Anda leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a Beda of pain oh he Has been talking about bunbury Has he yes he Has told mój all about poor mr bunbury Anda his terrible state of health well i won T have him talk to you about bunbury or about anything else Ita IS enough to drive on perfectly frantic of course i admit that the faults were all on my side buta i must say that i think that brother John sekunda coldness to mój IS peculiarly painful i expected a more enthusiastic welcome especially considering Ita IS the first time i have come here uncle Jack if you don T shake hands with Ernest i willa never forgive you never forgive mój never never never well this IS the last time i shall ever do Ita Ita S pleasant IS Ita NOT to see SO perfect a reconciliation i think w might leave the two brothers together cecily you willa come with US certainly miss prism my little task of reconciliation IS over you have done a beautiful action to day dear child w must NOT be premature in our judgments i feel Vera happy you Young scoundrel algy you must get out of this plac as soon as possible i don T allow any bunburying here i have put mr Ernest sekunda things in the room next to yours sir i suppose that IS all right mr Ernest sekunda luggage sir i have unpacked Ita Anda put Ita in the room next to your own three portmanteaus a dressing case two hat boxes Anda a large luncheon basket i AM afraid i can T stay more than a week this time merriman order the dog cart at once mr Ernest Has been suddenly called back to town what a fearful liar you are Jack i have NOT been called back to town at all yes you have i haven T heard any on call mój your duty as a gentleman calls you back my duty as a gentleman Has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree i can quite understand that well cecily IS a darling you are NOT to talk of miss cardew like that i don T like Ita well i don T like your clothes you look perfectly ridiculous in them why on earth don T you go UP Anda change Ita IS perfectly childish to be in deep Mourning for a man WHO IS actually staying for a whole week with you in your House as a guest i call Ita grotesque you are certainly NOT staying with mój for a whole week as a guest or anything else you have Got to leave by the four five train i certainly won T leave you SO long as you are in Mourning Ita would be most unfriendly if i were in Mourning you would stay with mój i suppose i should think Ita Vera unkind if you didn T well willa you on if i change my clothes yes if you are NOT too long i never Sawa anybody take SO long to dress Anda with such little result well at any rate that IS better than being always over dressed as you are if i AM occasionally a little over dressed i make UP for Ita by being always immensely over educated your vanity IS ridiculous your conduct an outrage Anda your presence in my garden utterly absurd however you have Got to catch the four five Anda i hope you willa have a pleasant journey back to town this bunburying as you call Ita Has NOT been a great success for you i think Ita Has been a great success I metr inaczej love with cecily Anda that IS everything but i must see Hera before i on Anda make arrangements for another bunbury ah there she IS oh i merely came back to water the roses i thought you were with uncle Jack he sekunda gone to order the dog cart for mój oh IS he going to take you for a Nika drive he sekunda going to send mój away then have w Got to part i AM afraid SO Ita sekunda a Vera painful parting Ita IS always painful to part from people whom on Has known for a Vera brief space of time the absence of old friends on can endure with equanimity but even a momentary separation from anyone to whom on Has Just been introduced IS almost unbearable the dog cart IS at the door sir Ita can wait merriman for five minutes i hope cecily i shall NOT offend you if i state quite frankly Anda openly that you seem to mój to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection i think your frankness does you great credit Ernest if you willa allow mój i willa copy your remarks into my diary do you really keep a diary I D give anything to look at Ita you see Ita IS simply a Vera Young girl S record of Hera own thoughts Anda impressions Anda consequently meant for publication when Ita appears in volume forma i hope you willa order a copy but pray Ernest don T stop I delight in taking Down from dictation i have reached absolute perfection you can go on i AM quite ready for more oh don T cough Ernest when on IS dictating on should speak fluently Anda NOT cough besides i don T know how to spell a cough cecily ever since i first looked upon your wonderful Anda incomparable beauty i have dared to love you wildly passionately devotedly hopelessly i don T think that you should tell mój that you love mój wildly passionately devotedly hopelessly hopelessly doesn T seem to make mucha sense does Ita the dog cart IS waiting sir Tell Ita to come round next week at the sam hour uncle Jack would be Vera mucha annoyed if he knew you were staying on till next week at the sam hour oh i don T care about Jack i don T care for anybody in the whole world but you i love you cecily you willa Marr mój won T you you silly Boy why w have been engaged for the last three months for the last three months yes Ita willa be exactly three months on thursday but how did w become engaged well ever since dear uncle Jack first confessed to US that he had a younger brother WHO wy Vera wicked Anda bad you of course have formed the chief topic of conversation between myself Anda miss prism Anda of course a man WHO IS mucha talked about IS always Vera attractive on feels there must be something in him after all i daresay Ita wy foolish of mój buta i fell in love with you Ernest Anda when wy the engagement actually settled on the th of februar last worn out by your entire ignorance of my existence i determined to end the matter on way or the other Anda after a long struggle with myself i accepted you under this dear old tree here the next day i bought this little ring in your name Anda this IS the little bangle with the true lover sekunda knot i promised you always to wear did i give you this Ita S Vera pretty isn T Ita yes you ve wonderfully good taste Ernest Ita S the excuse i ve always given for your leading such a bad life Anda this IS the box in which i keep all your dear letters but my own sweet cecily i have never written you any letters you need hardly remind mój of that Ernest i remember only too well that i wy forced to write your letters for you i wrote always three times a week Anda sometimes oftener oh do let mój read them cecily oh i couldn T possibly they would make you far too conceited the three you wrote mój after i had broken off the engagement are SO beautiful Anda SO badly spelled that even now i can hardly read them without crying a little but wy our engagement ever broken off of course Ita wy on the ND of last marcha you can see the entry if you like to day i broke off my engagement with Ernest i feel Ita IS better to do SO the weather still continues charming but why on earth did you break Ita off what had i done i had done nothing at all cecily i AM Vera mucha hurt indeed to hear you broke Ita off particularly when the weather wy SO charming Ita would hardly have been a really serious engagement if Ita hadn T been broken off at least once but i forgave you before the week wy out what a perfect Angel you are cecily you dear romantic Boy i hope your hair curls naturally does Ita yes darling with a little help from others i AM SO glad you ll never break off our engagement again cecily i don T think i could break Ita off now that i have actually meta you besides of course there IS the question of your name yes of course you must NOT laugh at mój darling buta Ita had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some on whose name wy Ernest there IS something in that name that seems to inspire absolute confidence i pita any poor married woman whose husband IS NOT called Ernest but my dear child do you mean to say you could NOT love mój if i had some other name but what name oh any name you like algernon for instance but i Don T like the name of algernon well my own dear sweet loving little darling i really can T see why you should object to the name of algernon Ita IS NOT at all a bad name in fact Ita IS rather an aristocratic name halfa of the chaps WHO get into the bankruptcy court are called algernon but seriously cecily if my name wy algy couldn T you love mój i might respect you Ernest i might admire your character but i fear that i should NOT be Abel to give you my undivided attention your rector here IS i suppose thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites Anda ceremonials of the church dr chasuble IS a most learned man he Has never written a singel book SO you can imagine how mucha he knows i must see him at once on a most important christening i mean on most important business i shan T be away more than halfa an hour considering that w have been engaged since februar the th Anda that i only meta you to day for the first time i think Ita IS rather hard that you should leave mój for SO long a period as halfa an hour couldn T you make Ita twenty minutes i ll be back in no time what an impetuous Boy he IS i like his hair SO mucha i must enter his proposal in my diary a miss fairfax Has Just called to see mr worthing on Vera important business miss fairfax states isn T mr worthing in his library mr worthing wenta over in the direction of the rectory some time Aga pray ask the lady to come out here mr worthing IS sure to be back soon Anda you can bring tea i suppose on of the mana good elderly women WHO are associated with uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London i don T quite like women WHO are interested in philanthropic work i think Ita IS SO forward of them pray let mój introduce myself to you my name IS cecily cardew what a Vera sweet name something tells mój that w are going to be great friends i like you already more than i can say my first impressions of people are never wrong how Nika of you to like mój SO mucha after w have known each other such a comparatively short time pray sit Down i May call you cecily May i NOT Anda you willa always call mój gwendolen won T you if you wish then that IS all quite settled IS Ita NOT i hope SO perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning WHO i AM my father IS lord bracknell you have never heard of papa i suppose i don T think SO outside the family circle papa i AM glad to say IS entirely unknown i think that IS quite as Ita should be the home seems to mój to be the proper sphere for the man Anda certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate does he NOT Anda i don T like that Ita makes MEN SO Vera attractive cecily mamma whose views on education are remarkably strict Has brought mój UP to be extremely short sighted Ita IS part of Hera system SO do you mind my looking at you through my glasses oh NOT at all gwendolen i AM Vera fond of being looked at you are here on a short visit i suppose i live here your mother no doubt or some female relative of advanced years resides here also i have no mother Nora in fact any relations my dear guardian with the assistance of miss prism Has the arduous task of looking after mój yes i AM mr worthing S ward Ita IS strange he never mentioned to mój that he had a ward how secretive of him he grows more interesting hourly i AM NOT sure however that the news inspires mój with feelings of unmixed delight i AM Vera fond of you cecily i have liked you ever since i meta you but i AM bound to state that now that i know that you are mr worthing sekunda ward i cannot help expressing a wish you were well Just a little older than you seem to be Anda NOT quite SO Vera alluring in appearance in fact if i May speak candidly i think that whenever on Has anything unpleasant to say on should always be quite Candida well to speak with perfect candour cecily i wish that you were fully forta two Anda more than usually plain for your Age Ernest Has a strong upright nature he IS the Vera soul of truth Anda honour disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception but even MEN of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influenca of the physical charms of others modern no less than ancient history supplies US with mana most painful examples of what i refer to if Ita were NOT SO indeed history would be quite unreadable i beg your pardon gwendolen did you say Ernest oh but Ita IS NOT mr Ernest worthing WHO IS my guardian Ita IS his brother his elder brother Ernest never mentioned to mój that he had a brother i AM sorry to say they have NOT been on good terms for a long time ah that accounts for Ita Anda now that i think of Ita i have never heard any man mention his brother the subject seems distasteful to most MEN cecily you have lifted a load from my mind i wy growing almost anxious Ita would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours would Ita NOT of course you are quite quite sure that Ita IS NOT mr Ernest worthing WHO IS your guardian in fact i AM going to be his i beg your pardon dearest gwendolen there IS no reason why i should make a Secret of Ita to you our little county newspaper IS sure to chronicle the fact next week mr Ernest worthing Anda i are engaged to be married my darling cecily i think there must be some slight error mr Ernest worthing IS engaged to mój the announcement willa appear in the morning post on saturday at the latest i AM afraid you must be under some misconception Ernest proposed to mój exactly ten minutes aga Ita IS certainly Vera curious for he asked mój to be his wife yesterday afternoon at if you would care to verify the incident pray do SO i never travel without my diary on should always have something sensational to read in the train i AM SO sorry dear cecily if Ita IS any disappointment to you but i AM afraid i have the prior claim Ita would distress mój more than i can tell you dear gwendolen if Ita caused you any mental or physical anguish but i feel bound to pointa out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly Has changed his mind if the poor fellow Has been entrapped into any foolish promise i shall consider Ita my duty to rescue him at once Anda with a firma hand whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear Boy May have Got into i willa never reproach him with Ita after w are married do you allude to mój miss cardew as an entanglement you are presumptuous on an occasion of this kind Ita becomes more than a moral duty to speak on sekunda mind Ita becomes a pleasure do you suggest miss fairfax that i entrapped Ernest into an engagement how dare you this IS no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners when i see a spade i call Ita a spade i AM glad to say that i have never seen a spade Ita IS obvious that our social spheres have been widely different shall i lay tea here as usual miss yes as usual are there mana interesting walks in the vicinity miss cardew oh yes a great mana from the top of on of the hills quite close on can see five counties i don T think I should like that i hate crowds i suppose that IS why you live in town quite a well kept garden this IS miss cardew SO glad you like Ita miss fairfax i had no idea there were any flowers in the country oh flowers are as common here miss fairfax as people are in London personally i cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the country if anybody WHO IS anybody does the country always bores mój to death this IS what the newspapers call agricultural depression IS Ita NOT i believe the aristocracy are suffering Vera mucha from Ita Just at present Ita IS almost an epidemic amongst them i have been told May i offer you some tea miss fairfax but i require tea no thank you sugar IS NOT fashionable any more cake or bread Anda butter bread Anda butter please cake IS rarely seen at the best houses nowadays hand that to miss fairfax you have filled my tea with lumps of sugar Anda though i asked most distinctly for bread Anda butter you have given mój cake i AM known for the gentleness of my disposition Anda the extraordinary sweetness of my nature buta i Warna you miss cardew you May on too far to save my poor Innocenta trusting Boy from the machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which i would NOT on from the moment i Sawa you i distrusted you i felt that you were false Anda deceitful i AM never deceived in such matters my first impressions of people are invariably right Ita seems to mój miss fairfax that i AM trespassing on your valuable time no doubt you have mana other calls of a similar character to make in the neighbourhood my own Ernest May i ask if you are engaged to be married to this Young lady to dear little cecily of course NOT what could have put such an idea into your pretty little head i knew there must be some misunderstanding miss fairfax the gentleman whose arm IS at present round your waist IS my guardian mr John worthing i beg your pardon this IS uncle Jack here IS Ernest my own love a moment Ernest May i ask you are you engaged to be married to this Young lady to what Young lady yes to good heavens gwendolen i mean to gwendolen of course NOT what could have put such an idea into your pretty little head i felt there wy some slight error miss cardew the gentleman WHO IS now embracing you IS my cousin mr algernon moncrieff are you called algernon i cannot deny Ita IS your name really John i could deny Ita if i liked i could deny anything if i liked but my name certainly IS John Ita Has been John for years a Gross deception Has been practised on both of US my poor wounded cecily my sweet wronged gwendolen you willa call mój sister willa you NOT there IS Just on question i would like to be allowed to ask my guardian an admirable idea mr worthing there IS Just on question i would like to be permitted to put to you where IS your brother Ernest w are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest SO Ita IS a matter of some importance to US to know where your brother Ernest IS at present gwendolen cecily Ita IS Vera painful for mój to be forced to speak the truth Ita IS the first time in my life that i have ever been reduced to such a painful position Anda i AM really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind however i willa tell you quite frankly that i have no brother Ernest i have no brother at all i never had a brother in my life Anda i certainly have NOT the smallest intention of ever having on in the future no brother at all had you never a brother of any kind NOT even of an kind i AM afraid Ita IS quite clear cecily that neither of US IS engaged to be married to any on Ita IS NOT a Vera pleasant position for a Young girl suddenly to find herself in let US on into the house they willa hardly venture to come after US there no MEN are SO cowardly arena T they this ghastly state of things IS what you call bunburying i suppose yes Anda a perfectly wonderful bunbury Ita IS the most wonderful bunbury i have ever had in my life well you ve no right whatsoever to bunbury here that IS absurd on Has a right to bunbury anywhere on chooses every serious bunburyist knows that well on must be serious about something if on wants to have any amusement in life i happen to be serious about bunburying what on earth you are serious about i haven T Got the remotest idea about everything i should fancy you have such an absolutely trivial nature well the only small satisfaction i have in the whole of this wretched business IS that your friend bunbury IS quite exploded you won T be Abel to run Down to the country quite SO often as you used to do dear algy Anda a Vera good thing too your brother IS a little off colour isn T he dear Jack you won T be Abel to disappear to London quite SO frequently as your wicked custom wy Anda NOT a bad thing either as for your conduct towards miss cardew i must say that your taking in a sweet simple Innocenta girl like that IS quite inexcusable to say nothing of the fact that she IS my ward i can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant clever thoroughly experienced Young lady like miss fairfax to say nothing of the fact that she IS my cousin i wanted to be engaged to gwendolen that IS all i love Hera well i simply wanted to be engaged to cecily i adore Hera there IS certainly no chance of your marrying miss cardew i don T think there IS mucha likelihood Jack of you Anda miss fairfax being united well that IS no business of yours if Ita wy my business i wouldn T talk about Ita Ita IS Vera vulgar to talk about on sekunda business only people like stock brokers do that Anda then merely at dinner parties how can you sit there calmly eating muffins when w are in this horrible trouble i can T make out you seem to mój to be perfectly heartless well i can T eat muffins in an agitated manner the butter would probably get on my cuffs on should always eat muffins quite calmly Ita IS the only way to eat them i say Ita sekunda perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all under the circumstances when i AM in trouble eating IS the only thing that consoles mój indeed when i AM in really great trouble as any on WHO knows mój intimately willa tell you i refuse everything except food Anda drink at the present moment i AM eating muffins because i AM unhappy besides i AM particularly fond of muffins well that IS no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way i wish you would have tea cake instead i don T like tea cake i suppose a man May eat his own muffins in his own garden but you have Just said Ita wy perfectly heartless to eat muffins i said Ita wy perfectly heartless of you under the circumstances that IS a Vera different thing that May be but the muffins are the sam algy i wish to goodness you would on you can T possibly ask mój to on without having some dinner i never on without my dinner no on ever does except vegetarians Anda people like that besides i have Just made arrangements with dr chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of Ernest my dear fellow the sooner you give UP that nonsense the better i made arrangements this morning with dr chasuble to be christened myself at Anda i naturally willa take the name of Ernest gwendolen would wish Ita w can T both be christened Ernest besides i have a perfect right to be christened if i like there IS no evidence at all that i have ever been christened by anybody i should think Ita extremely probable i never wy Anda SO does dr chasuble Ita IS entirely different in your case you have been christened already yes but i have NOT been christened for years yes but you have been christened that IS the important thing SO i know my constitution can stand Ita if you are NOT quite sure about your ever having been christened i must say i think Ita rather dangerous your venturing on Ita now Ita might make you Vera unwell you can hardly have forgotten that some on Vera closely connected with you wy Vera nearly carried off this week in paris by a severe chill yes but you said yourself that a severe chill wy NOT hereditary Ita usen T to be i know but i daresay Ita IS now science IS always making wonderful improvements in things oh that IS nonsense you are always talking nonsense Jack you are at the muffins again i wish you wouldn T there are only two left i told you i wy particularly fond of muffins but i hate tea cake why on earth then do you allow tea cake to be served UP for your guests what ideas you have of hospitality i have already told you to on i don T wanta you here why don T you on i haven T quite finished my tea yet Anda there IS still on muffin left morning room at the manor house the fact that they did NOT follow US at once into the house as any on else would have done seems to mój to show that they have some sense of shame left they have been eating muffins that looks like repentance they don T seem to notice US at all couldn T you cough but i haven T Got a cough they RE looking at US that S Vera forward of them let US preserve a dignified silence Ita sekunda the only thing to do now this dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect a most distasteful on buta w willa NOT be the first to speak mr worthing i have something Vera particular to ask you mucha depends on your reply gwendolen your common sense IS invaluable mr moncrieff kindly answer mój the following question why did you pretend to be my guardian sekunda brother in order that i might have an opportunity of meeting you that certainly seems a satisfactory explanation does Ita NOT yes dear if you can believe him but that does NOT affect the wonderful beauty of his answer in matters of grave importance styl NOT sincerity IS the vital thing mr worthing what explanation can you offer to mój for pretending to have a brother wy Ita in order that you might have an opportunity of coming UP to town to see mój as often as possible can you doubt Ita miss fairfax i have the gravest doubts upon the subject but i intend to crush them this IS NOT the moment for german scepticism their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory especially mr worthing sekunda that seems to mój to have the stamp of truth upon Ita i AM more than content with what mr moncrieff said his voice alone inspires on with absolute credulity then you think we should forgive them i mean no i had forgotten there are principles at stake that on cannot surrender which of US should tell them the task IS NOT a pleasant on could w NOT both speak at the sam time an excellent idea i nearly always speak at the sam time as other people willa you take the time from mój gwendolen Anda cecily your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier that IS all Jack Anda algernon our Christian names IS that all but w are going to be christened this afternoon for my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing to please mój you are ready to face this fearful ordeal how absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes where questions of self sacrifice are concerned MEN are infinitely beyond US they have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing what does this mean merely that i AM engaged to be married to mr worthing mamma sit Down immediately hesitation of any kind IS a sign of mental decay in the Young of physical weakness in the old apprised sir of my daughter sekunda sudden flight by Hera trust maid whose confidence i purchased by means of a small coin i followed Hera at once by a luggage train Hera unhappy father IS i AM glad to say under the impression that she IS attending a more than usually lengthy lecture by the university extension scheme on the influenca of a permanent income on thought i do NOT propose to undeceive him indeed i have never undeceived him on any question i would consider Ita wrong but of course you willa clearly understand that all communication between yourself Anda my daughter must cease immediately from this moment on this pointa as indeed on all points i AM firma i AM engaged to be married to gwendolen lady bracknell you are nothing of the kind sir Anda now as regards algernon algernon yes aunt Augusta May i ask if Ita IS in this house that your invalid friend mr bunbury resides bunbury doesn T live here bunbury IS somewhere else at present in fact bunbury IS dead when did mr bunbury die his death must have been extremely sudden i killed bunbury this afternoon i mean poor bunbury died this afternoon what did he die of oh he wy quite exploded wy he the victim of a revolutionary outrage i wy NOT aware that mr bunbury wy interested in social legislation if SO he IS well punished for his morbidity my dear aunt August i mean he wy found out the doctors found out that bunbury could NOT live that IS what i mean SO bunbury

advice Anda now that w have finally Got rid of this mr bunbury May i ask mr worthing WHO IS that Young persona whose hand my nephew algernon IS now holding in what seems to mój a peculiarly unnecessary manner that lady IS miss cecily cardew my ward i AM engaged to be married to cecily aunt August i beg your pardon mr moncrieff Anda i are engaged to be married lady bracknell i do NOT know whether there IS anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part of hertfordshire but the number of engagements that go on seems to mój considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid Down for our guidance i think some preliminary inquiry on my part would NOT be out of plac mr worthing IS miss cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in London i merely desire information until yesterday i had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin wy a terminus miss cardew IS the grand daughter of the late mr Thomas cardew of belgrave square sekunda w gervase park dorking surrey Anda the sporran fifeshire N bit that sounds NOT unsatisfactory three addresses always inspire confidence even in tradesmen but what proof have i of their authenticity i have carefully preserved the court guides of the period they are open to your inspection lada bracknell i have known strange errors in that publication miss cardew sekunda family solicitors are messrs markby markby Anda markby markby markby Anda markby a firma of the Vera highest position in their profession indeed i AM told that on of the mr markby sekunda IS occasionally to be seen at dinner parties SO far i AM satisfied how extremely kind of you lady bracknell i have also in my possession you willa be pleased to hear certificates of miss cardew sekunda birth baptism whooping cough registration vaccination confirmation Anda the measles both the german Anda the english variety ah a life crowded with incident i see though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a Young girl i AM NOT myself inaczej favour of premature experiences gwendolen the time approaches for our departure w have NOT a moment to lose as a matter of forma mr worthing i had better ask you if miss cardew Has any little fortune oh about a hundred Anda thirty thousand pounds in the funds that IS all goodbye lady bracknell SO pleased to have seen you a moment mr worthing a hundred Anda thirty thousand pounds Anda in the funds miss cardew seems to mój a most attractive Young lada now that i look at Hera few girlsa of the present day have any really solid qualities any of the qualities that last Anda improve with time w live i regret to say in an Age of surfaces come over here dear pretty child your dress IS sadly simple Anda your hair seems almost as nature might have left Ita but w can soon alter all that a thoroughly experienced french maid produces a really marvellous result in a Vera brief space of time i remember recommending on to Young lada lancing Anda after three months Hera own husband did NOT know Hera Anda after six months nobody knew Hera kindly turn round sweet child no the side view IS what i wanta yes quite as i expected there are distinct social possibilities in your profil the two weak points in our Age are its wanta of principle Anda its wanta of profil the china a little higher dear styl largely depends on the way the china IS worn they are worn Vera high Just at present yes aunt Augusta there are distinct social possibilities in miss cardew S profil cecily IS the sweetest dearest prettiest girl in the whole world Anda i don T care twopence about social possibilities never speak disrespectfully of Society algernon only people WHO can T get into Ita do that dear child of course you know that algernon Has nothing but his debts to depend upon but i do NOT approve of mercenary marriages when i married lord bracknell i had no fortune of any kind but i never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way well i suppose i must give my consent thank you aunt Augusta cecily you May kiss mój thank you lady bracknell you May also address mój as aunt Augusta for the future thank you aunt august the marriage i think had better take plac quite soon thank you aunt Augusta thank you aunt Augusta to speak frankly i AM NOT in favour of long engagements they give people the opportunity of finding out each other sekunda character before marriage which i think IS never advisable i beg your pardon for interrupting you lady bracknell but this engagement IS quite out of the question i AM miss cardew S guardian Anda she cannot Marr without my consent until she comes of Age that consent i absolutely decline to give upon what grounds May i ask algernon IS an extremely i May almost say an ostentatiously eligible Young man he Has nothing but he looks everything what more can on desire Ita pains mój Vera mucha to have to speak frankly to you lady bracknell about your nephew but the fact IS that i do NOT approve at all of his moral character i suspect him of being untruthful my nephew algernon he IS an oxonian i fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter this afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romanca he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother under an assumed name he drank i ve Just been informed by my butler an entire pint bottle of my perrier jouet brut wine i wy specially reserving for myself continuing his disgraceful deception he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward he subsequently stayed to tea Anda devoured every singel muffin Anda what makes his conduct all the more heartless IS that he wy perfectly well aware from the first that i have no brother that i never had a brother Anda that i don T intend to have a brother NOT even of any kind i distinctly told him SO myself yesterday afternoon mr worthing after careful consideration i have decided entirely to overlook my nephew sekunda conduct to you that IS Vera generous of you lady bracknell my own decision however IS unalterable i decline to give my consent come here sweet child how old are you dear well i AM really only eighteen but i always admit to twenty when i on to evening parties you are perfectly right in making some slight alteration indeed no woman should ever be quite accurate about Hera Age Ita looks SO calculating eighteen but admitting to twenty at evening parties well Ita willa NOT be Vera long before you are of Age Anda free from the restraints of tutelage SO i Don T think your guardian sekunda consent IS after all a matter of any importance pray excuse mój lady bracknell for interrupting you again but Ita IS only fair to tell you that according to the terms of Hera grandfather S willa miss cardew does NOT come legally of Age till she IS thirty five that does NOT seem to mój to be a grave objection thirty five IS a Vera attractive Age London Society IS full of women of the Vera highest birth WHO have of their own free choica remained thirty five for years lady dumbleton IS an instance in pointa to my own knowledge she Has been thirty five ever since she arrived at the Age of forta which wy mana years aga now i see no reason why our dear cecily should NOT be even still more attractive at the Age you mention than she IS at present there willa be a large accumulation of property algy could you wait for mój till i wy thirty five of course i could cecily you know i could yes i felt Ita instinctively buta i couldn T wait all that time i hate waiting even five minutes for anybody Ita always makes mój rather cross i AM NOT punctual myself i know but i do like punctuality in others Anda waiting even to be married IS quite out of the question then what IS to be done cecily i don T know mr moncrieff my dear mr worthing as miss cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she IS thirty five a remark which i AM bound to say seems to mój to show a somewhat impatient nature i would beg of you to reconsider your decision but my dear lady bracknell the matter IS entirely in your own hands the moment you consent to my marriage with gwendolen i willa most gladly allow your nephew to forma an alliance with my ward you must be quite aware that what you propose IS out of the question then a passionate celibacy IS all that any of US can look forward to that IS NOT the destiny i propose for gwendolen algernon of course can choose for himself come dear w have already missed five if NOT six trains to miss any more might expose US to comment on the platforma everything IS quite ready for the christenings the christenings sir IS NOT that somewhat premature both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism at their Age the idea IS grotesque Anda irreligious algernon i forbid you to be baptized i willa NOT hear of such excesses lord bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that wy the way in which you wasted your time Anda money AM i to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon i don T think that as things are now Ita would be of mucha practical value to either of US dr chasuble i AM grieved to hear such sentiments from you mr worthing they savour of the heretical views of the anabaptists views that i have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons however as your present mood seems to be on peculiarly secular i willa return to the church at once indeed i have Just been informed by the pew opener that for the last hour Anda a halfa miss prism Has been waiting for mój in the vestry did i hear you mention a miss prism yes lady bracknell i AM on my way to join Hera pray allow mój to detain you for a moment this matter May prove to be on of vital importance to lord bracknell Anda myself IS this miss prism a female of repellent aspect remotely connected with education she IS the most cultivated of ladies Anda the Vera picture of respectability Ita IS obviously the sam persona May i ask what position she holds in your household i AM a celibate madama miss prism lada bracknell Has been for the last three years miss cardew S esteemed governess Anda valued companion in spity of what i hear of Hera i must see Hera at once let Hera be sent for she approaches she IS nigh i wy told you expected mój in the vestry dear canon i have been waiting for you there for an hour Anda three quarters come here prism where IS that baba twenty eight years aga prism you left lord bracknell sekunda House number upper grosvenor Street in charge of a perambulator that contained a baba of the male sex you never returned a few weeks later through the elaborate investigations of the metropolitan polica the perambulator wy discovered at midnight standing by itself in a remote corner of bayswater Ita contained the manuscript of a three volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality but the baba wy NOT there where IS that baba lada bracknell i admit with shame that i do NOT know i only wish i did the plain facts of the case are these on the morning of the day you mention a day that IS for ever branded on my memory i prepared as usual to take the baba out in its perambulator i had also with mój a somewhat old but capacious hand bag in which i had intended to plac the manuscript of a work of fiction that i had written during my few unoccupied hours in a moment of mental abstraction for which i never can forgive myself i deposited the manuscript in the basinette Anda placed the baba in the hand bag but where did you deposit the hand bag do NOT ask mój mr worthing miss prism this IS a matter of no small importance to mój i insist on knowing where you deposited the hand bag that contained that infant i left Ita in the cloak room of on of the larger railway stations in London what railway station the brighton line i must retire to my room for a moment gwendolen wait here for mój if you are NOT too long i willa wait here for you all my life what do you think this means lada bracknell i dare NOT even suspect dr chasuble i need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are NOT supposed to occur they are hardly considered the thing uncle Jack seems strangely agitated your guardian Has a Vera emotional nature this noise IS extremely unpleasant Ita sounds as if he wy having an argument i dislike arguments of any kind they are always vulgar Anda often convincing Ita Has stopped now i wish he would arrive at some conclusion this suspense IS terrible i hope Ita willa last IS this the hand bag miss prism examine Ita carefully before you speak the happiness of more than on life depends on your answer Ita seems to be mine yes here IS the injury Ita received through the upsetting of a gower Street omnibus in younger Anda happier days here IS the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage an incident that occurred at leamington Anda here on the lock are my initials i had forgotten that in an extravagant mood i had had them placed there the bag IS undoubtedly mine i AM delighted to have Ita SO unexpectedly restored to mój Ita Has been a great inconvenience being without Ita all these years miss prism more IS restored to you than this hand bag i wy the baba you placed in Ita yes mother i AM unmarried i do NOT deny that IS a serious blow but after all WHO Has the right to cast a Stone against on WHO Has suffered cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly why should there be on lawa for MEN Anda another for women mother i forgive you mr worthing there IS some error there IS the lady WHO can tell you WHO you really are lady bracknell i hate to seem inquisitive but would you kindly inform mój WHO i AM i AM afraid that the news i have to give you willa NOT altogether please you you are the son of my poor sister mrs moncrieff Anda consequently algernon sekunda elder brother algy sekunda elder brother then i have a brother after all i knew i had a brother i always said i had a brother cecily how could you have ever doubted that i had a brother chasuble my unfortunate brother miss prism my unfortunate brother gwendolen my unfortunate brother algy you Young scoundrel you willa have to treat mój with more respect in the future you have never behaved to mój like a brother in all your life well NOT till to day old Boy i admit i did my best however though i wy out of practice but what own are you what IS your Christian name now that you have become some on else good heavens i had quite forgotten that pointa your decision on the subject of my name IS irrevocable i suppose i never change except in my affections what a nobel nature you have gwendolen then the question had better be cleared UP at once aunt Augusta a moment at the time when miss prism left mój in the hand bag had i been christened already every luxury that money could buy including christening had been lavished on you by your fond Anda doting parents then i wy christened that IS settled now what name wy i given let mój know the worst being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father yes but what wy my father sekunda Christian name i cannot at the present moment recall what the general sekunda Christian name wy buta i have no doubt he had on he wy eccentric i admit but only in later years Anda that wy the result of the Indiana climate Anda marriage Anda indigestion Anda other things of that kind can T you recollect what our father sekunda Christian name wy my dear Boy w were never even on speaking terms he died before i wy a year old his name would appear in the army lists of the period i suppose aunt Augusta the general wy essentially a man of peace except in his domestic life but i have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory the army lists of the last forta years are here these delightful records should have been my constant study M generals mallam maxbohm magley what ghastly names they have markby migsby mobbs moncrieff lieutenant captain lieutenant colonel colonel general Christian names Ernest John i always told you gwendolen my name wy Ernest didn T i well Ita IS Ernest after all i mean Ita naturally IS Ernest yes i remember now that the general wy called Ernest i knew i had some particular reason for disliking the name my own Ernest i felt from the first that you could have no other name gwendolen Ita IS a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he Has been speaking nothing but the truth can you forgive mój for i feel that you are sure to change my own on my nephew you seem to be displaying signs of triviality on the contrary aunt Augusta i ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital importance of being earnest
